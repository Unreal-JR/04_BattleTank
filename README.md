# Unreal Engine Developer Course - Section 4 - Battle Tank

This project is from the [Unreal Engine Developer]( http://gdev.tv/urcgithub) course â€“ it started as a runaway success on Kickstarter and has gone on to become one of the bestselling Unreal courses on the internet! Continually updated in response to student suggestions, you will benefit from the fact we have already taught over 360,336 students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

Here I make a repo myself to do version control, and you are welcome to download those files or share your experience with me. You can check out the course here: [Unreal Engine Developer]( http://gdev.tv/urcgithub)
